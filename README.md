ðŸ“– Introduction:
The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It is commonly used for fetching data, managing subscriptions, handling timers, and updating the DOM after render.

ðŸš€ Why useEffect?
Runs after the component renders.
Can be controlled to run only when specific values change.
Supports cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks.

ðŸ“Œ Common Use Cases:
âœ” Fetching data from an API
âœ” Subscribing to events (WebSockets, Firebase, etc.)
âœ” Managing timers (setTimeout, setInterval)
âœ” Updating the document title or modifying the DOM
âœ” Cleaning up event listeners when a component unmounts

âš¡ Behavior of useEffect:
By default, it runs after every render.
Can be configured to run only once (on mount) or only when dependencies change.
Supports a cleanup function to handle unsubscriptions and memory management.

ðŸ›  Best Practices:
Use dependencies wisely to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
Always clean up subscriptions and timers in the cleanup function.
Avoid unnecessary API calls by optimizing dependency arrays.

ðŸ“œ Key Takeaways:
useEffect simplifies handling side effects in functional components.
Proper dependency management ensures optimized performance.
Cleanup functions prevent memory leaks and ensure better app performance.
